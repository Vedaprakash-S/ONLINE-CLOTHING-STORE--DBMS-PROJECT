ABSTRACT

The Online Clothing Store Management System is a dynamic Java application developed in Eclipse, utilizing MySQL for efficient database management. This system is designed to offer a seamless shopping experience for users by incorporating essential features such as user authentication, profile management, order placement, and billing.
The application begins with a user-friendly login page, followed by options for new users to sign up or existing users to recover forgotten passwords. Upon successful authentication, users are directed to a profile creation page where they can input personal details and preferences.
The core functionality of the system lies in its ability to facilitate the purchase of various clothing items. Users can browse through a wide variety of garments including shirts, pants, t-shirts, kurtis, and trousers. Upon selecting desired items, users proceed to place orders, specifying size, color, and quantity as per their preferences.It also has an add to cart optiom where orders can be placed later too after the filteration.
After confirming the order, the system automatically generates a detailed bill summarizing the total cost of purchased items. This bill includes a breakdown of prices for each item along with the expected delivery date, providing users with a clear overview of their purchase.
With its intuitive interface and robust functionality, the Online Clothing Store Management System aims to enhance the overall shopping experience for users while optimizing operational efficiency for the store administrators.
